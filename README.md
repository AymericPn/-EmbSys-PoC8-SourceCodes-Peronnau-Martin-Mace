### Intelligent traffic light POC
The aim of this project was to do a small intelligent traffic light with the following features :  

Changing the light from red to green on one light and from green to red on the other (we simulate a crossing between a main road and a secondary road) if there is a vehicule approaching  
Monitoring the level of pollution.  
Displaying a message on a screen if the level is too high.    
Monitoring the level of noise so the city officials can have information on the level of noise due to traffic in different districts.  
Displaying graphs with the data to help the community make decisions. 

We used a esp32 microcontroller, a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a MQ-7 gas sensor and small leds.
